# Weather App

This project aims to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly application to obtain weather information for any city. The application leverages various technologies and APIs learned during my studies.

- **Google Sheets API**: For storing and retrieving user data.
- **Weather API**: For fetching real-time weather data.
- **JSON Manipulation**: For handling and parsing data.
- **Pandas DataFrames**: For data analysis and manipulation.
